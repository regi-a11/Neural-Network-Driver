Neural Network Traffic Driver
This project demonstrates a neural network-powered car navigating through traffic in a web-based simulation. Built entirely from scratch using vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, it showcases the power of machine learning in a visually engaging, interactive environment.

Features:

Neural network implementation without external libraries
Real-time traffic simulation
Interactive web interface
Adjustable parameters for learning and simulation
Responsive design for various screen sizes

How It Works:
The core of this project is a custom-built neural network that controls a virtual car. The network takes inputs from the simulated environment (such as distance to other vehicles and road boundaries) and outputs driving decisions (steering, acceleration, braking).
As the simulation runs, the neural network learns to improve its driving performance through a process of trial and error, gradually becoming more adept at navigating traffic.

Tech Stack:
HTML5 Canvas for rendering
Vanilla JavaScript for logic and neural network implementation
CSS for styling

Future Improvements

Add more complex traffic scenarios
Implement different learning algorithms
Allow users to train their own networks
Expand visualization of the neural network's decision-making process
